This is one way to make the graphics responsive.\r\n* A simple game loop which calculates delta and can be started and stopped.\r\n* A player entity which can be moved around the canvas using the arrow keys.\r\n* A \"Game Over\" screen when player is moved outside bounds, where the game can be restarted.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\nbower install\r\ngrunt server\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
